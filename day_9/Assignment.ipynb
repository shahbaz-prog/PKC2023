    "\"NaN\" stands for \"Not a Number\" and is used to represent missing or null values in a dataset.\n",
    "It is important to identify and handle NaN values in a dataset because they can affect the accuracy and reliability of statistical analyses and machine learning models that are built using the data. For example, if a model is trained on a dataset that contains missing values, the model may not be able to accurately make predictions for new data that also contains missing values. Therefore, it is important to identify and fill or drop NaN values in a dataset before using it to build a model."
