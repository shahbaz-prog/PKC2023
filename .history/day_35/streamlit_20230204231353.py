st.write("""Age : Age of the patient

Sex : Sex of the patient

cp : Chest Pain type

Value 0: typical angina

Value 1: atypical angina

Value 2: non-anginal pain

Value 3: asymptomatic

trtbps : resting blood pressure (in mm Hg)

chol: cholesterol in mg/dl fetched via BMI sensor

fbs: (fasting blood sugar > 120 mg/dl)

1 = true

0 = false

rest_ecg: resting electrocardiographic results
Value 0: normal

Value 1: having ST-T wave abnormality (T wave inversions and/or ST elevation or depression of > 0.05 mV)

Value 2: showing probable or definite left ventricular hypertrophy by Estes' criteria

thalach: maximum heart rate achieved

exang: exercise induced angina

1 = yes

0 = no

old peak: ST depression induced by exercise relative to rest

slp: the slope of the peak exercise ST segment

0 = unsloping

1 = flat

2 = downsloping

caa: number of major vessels (0-3)

thall : thalassemia

output: diagnosis of heart disease (angiographic disease status)
0: < 50% diameter narrowing. less chance of heart disease

1: > 50% diameter narrowing. more chance of heart disease""")
