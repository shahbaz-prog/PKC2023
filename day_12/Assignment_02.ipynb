    "- Min-Max Normalization: This technique scales the data between a range of 0 to 1. It is useful for data that has outliers or extreme values.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Z-Score Normalization: This technique standardizes the data by calculating the mean and standard deviation of the data. It helps in removing the skewness of the data and makes it more symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Log Transformation: This technique is useful for data that has a skewed distribution. It helps in reducing the impact of outliers and makes the data more symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Box-Cox Transformation: This technique is used to transform non-normal data into a normal distribution. It helps in removing skewness and kurtosis from the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Binning: This technique is used to group data into discrete intervals. It helps in reducing the impact of outliers and making the data more symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outlier Detection and Removal: This technique involves identifying and removing outliers from the data. This helps in reducing the impact of outliers and making the data more symmetric.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Imputation: This technique involves replacing missing or null values with a suitable value. This helps in reducing the impact of missing data and making the data more symmetric."
